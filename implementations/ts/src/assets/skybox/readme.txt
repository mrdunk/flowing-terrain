Cloudy skyboxes
---------------
Last updated August 10, 2012
====================================

4 color variations of a cloudy afternoon skybox with mixed types of clouds.

I originally just made the blue version, but I figured having some premade variations might be useful.

Blue: high key and somewhat cooled down.
Gray: more contrast and whitebalanced, more sombre.
Brown: somewhat of a sickly brown tinted version, a bit reminiscent of aged romantic paintings.
Yellow: funky bright orange/yellow tinted.

====================================
Technical Tidbits
====================================

Max quality baseline JPG compression.

For HDR enabled engines, overbrightening the high-end with a threshold of 0.7 and multiplier of 1.5 seems to look natural.
There are pure white highlights present inside some of the textures.

The sides are named and oriented in the Quake tradition, you might need to re-orient them for engines that use a different cubemap/skybox layout.
